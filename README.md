# Health Notifier
This plugin notifies you when your target dies or is below a certain hp.
# Usage
In the plugin's config you can choose what health level you want to be notified at (set it to 0 to notify when the target dies).
You can make the plugin notify only for certain npcs by adding the npc's name to the text box in the plugin's settings (leave it blank to notify for all npcs).
You can have the plugin notify for more than one npc name by separating the names with commas or by putting them on separate lines.
